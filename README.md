# Opulus
Opulus is a high-performance bytecode-compiled programming language

Developed and designed by Arnau478

# Build opulus
To compiler from source on Linux, follow the steps below.

1. Download [the latest release](https://github.com/Arnau478/opulus/releases)
2. Make sure you have `gcc` and `make` installed
3. Run the following command from shell:
```shell
$ make opulus
```
4. An executable named `opulus` will be generated. That's the compiler.

# How to use
You can run Opulus in two different ways

## REPL (**R**ead-**E**val-**P**rint **L**oop)
If you just execute the compiler, you will enter this mode. Here, you can type lines of code that get immediately executed.

## File execute
Most of the time, you will need to execute an opulus source file. You can do this by passing the file name as the only parameter to the opulus executable. The file will be run.

# Opulus
This is basically the programming language I've been planning to create for about 1 year now

## But... where's the code?
All the code will be on `develop` branch until production

## Why another programming language?
I know I have a lot of programming languages. Some of them are compiled and some of them are interpreted. But the fact that I start this one doesn't mean I'm going to quit developing them. It's just that I want to try some new things. Also, most of the languages I've made are compiled to native code, so I wanted to develop a JIT bytecode one.
